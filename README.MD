Thank you for taking interest in applying into our ICT Conscript Program. 

In this repository you will find our **Admission Test** to the program. 

# 1. What we are looking for?
We‚Äôre looking for individuals who are eager to grow and contribute in the following roles:
1. **Software Developer** - Backend/API development, Identity Provider integrations (IdPs), frontend development (web or mobile)
2. **Devops/Infra Developer** - Cloud platforms, Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Terraform), automation and CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions), platform operations
3. **PX/Product Designer** -  User experience design, wireframing, user communication, early product scoping
4. **Product Owner/Scrum Master** - Supporting development teams through leadership and operational coordination. Responsibilities may include: stakeholder management, backlog prioritization, customer satisfaction, and team rituals


# 2. How do I perform the Admission Test?
The process is straightforward: choose a task, fork the repository, complete your work, and submit it. Follow the steps below carefully:
### 1. Tasks are located in the **/challenges folder**. 
- All tasks are located in the /challenges folder.
- Pick the task that interests you the most.
‚úÖ You only need to complete one task‚Äînot all of them.
. Each task will be assessed independently (per-task assessment).
üîÑ Completing multiple tasks does not necessarily improve your standing. We are selecting people for different roles, not based on volume.

### 3. Fork the repo (IMPORTANT) & Do!
- Fork this repository to your GitHub account (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/test-ictadmission).
- Complete your selected task(s) directly in the forked repository.
- If your work includes external content (e.g., Figma, slides, diagrams), link everything clearly in your fork‚Äôs README.md.
- Ensure that your forked repository is public, so we can access it without issues.

üìù For UX Designers (Type 3) or Product Owners/Scrum Masters (Type 4):
Make sure to link all deliverables (e.g., wireframes, research notes, plans) in your README.md.

### 4. Submit your Admission Test
Once your test is ready, send an email to: ```ictvmhaku.pvjjk (at) mil.fi```
Include the following in your message:
- Your full name
- A link to your forked, public GitHub repository
- See the format below, use that!

‚ö†Ô∏è All other documentation should already be in your repository. Do not include additional details in the email.

**You can return an incomplete Test** (a task that fails to fulfill the given goals) **as well. If you do so, please detail in your email why you couldn't complete the task.**

### 5. Await pre-selection results
After submitting your test:
- We will evaluate your work.
- Based on both your OmaIntti application and Admission Test, if applicable, we‚Äôll decide if you move to the interview stage.

You will be notified if you are selected for an interview.

Final selections are made after all interviews are completed.
